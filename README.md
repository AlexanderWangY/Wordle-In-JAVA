# Wordle In JAVA
This is a reconstruction of New York Time's popular internet game Wordle except in Java.
## Instructions
USE AN IDE THAT CAN SHOW ANSI COLORS (for example, I use Intellij Community)

Download Wordle.java and the Word.txt file.

Inside the Wordle.java code you will see places to put your file path in the "#" areas.

Copy and paste the correct filepath that links it to the txt file.

ENJOY!
